# Project 

#### My data is already demultiplexed because I received the sequences separately for each sample with their respective barcodes. My data is paired-end data, because I have both reads provided per sample (Read 1 and Read 2). 

*See `MyMetaData_Pilot_Pisaster_Fall2020.csv` for metadata file in project branch*

## Work-Flow for Analyzing Amplicon Sequence Data for Microbiome Analysis using Qiime 2 and R Studio 

*See `DownloadQiime.sh` for script under ScriptsProject directory in project branch*

##### For this assignment, students will write a document describing analysis of their data. A well-written Final Project will have short sections analogous to a Methods, Results, and Discussion section of a published scientific paper. The Methods section will describe the procedures used to perform the analyses, demonstrate applications of concepts introduced in the course, and code will be hosted on GitHub. The Results section will present both data analyses (especially statistical analysis) and plots. The Discussion will briefly synthesize the take home messages from your analysis. A successful write up of a final project should be 750-1,000 words.
